* poly-gams

=poly-gams.el= is an Emacs package that provides polymode support for GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System), allowing for embedded Python and YAML code blocks within GAMS files. This package leverages =polymode= to enable seamless multi-mode editing.

** Features
- *GAMS Mode*: Syntax highlighting and editing support for GAMS code, inherited from =[[https://github.com/ShiroTakeda/gams-mode][gams-mode]]=.
- *Embedded Python*: Syntax highlighting and editing support for [[https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_EmbeddedCode.html#UG_EmbeddedCode_Python][Python code blocks]] embedded within GAMS files.
- *Embedded YAML*: Syntax highlighting and editing support for YAML code blocks embedded within GAMS files and used by [[https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_GAMSCONNECT.html][GAMS Connect]].

** Installation

This package is not yet available in MELPA, so you have to install it from source. This can be done as follows by adding the following to your =init.el= (with Emacs>=29)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(unless (package-installed-p 'poly-gams)
  (package-vc-install
   '(poly-gams :url "https://github.com/ShiroTakeda/poly-gams")))
(use-package poly-gams)
#+end_src

** Usage

Once installed, =poly-gams= will automatically activate for files with the =.gms= extension.

*** Keybindings

=poly-gams= inherits keybindings from =polymode=, =gams-mode=, =python-mode=, and =yaml-mode=. Refer to the respective mode documentation for more information.

** Customization

Currently, =poly-gams= does not expose customizable variables. The package is designed to work out of the box for most use cases.
