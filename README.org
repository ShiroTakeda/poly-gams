=poly-gams= is an Emacs package that provides polymode support for GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System), allowing for embedded Python and YAML code blocks within GAMS files. This package leverages [[https://polymode.github.io/][polymode]] to enable seamless multi-mode editing.

** Features
- *GAMS Mode*: Syntax highlighting and editing support for GAMS code, inherited from [[https://github.com/ShiroTakeda/gams-mode][gams-mode]].
- *Embedded Python*: Syntax highlighting and editing support for [[https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_EmbeddedCode.html#UG_EmbeddedCode_Python][Python code blocks]] embedded within GAMS files.
- *Embedded YAML*: Syntax highlighting and editing support for YAML code blocks embedded within GAMS files and used by [[https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_GAMSCONNECT.html][GAMS Connect]].

** Installation

This package is available on MELPA. Using =use-package=, installation can be done by adding the following to your =init.el=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package poly-gams
  :ensure t)
#+end_src

** Usage

Once installed, =poly-gams= will automatically activate for files with the =.gms= extension.

*** Keybindings

=poly-gams= inherits keybindings from =polymode=, =gams-mode=, =python-mode=, and =yaml-mode=. Refer to the respective mode documentation for more information.

** Customization

Currently, =poly-gams= does not expose customizable variables. The package is designed to work out of the box for most use cases. Refer to =polymode=, =gams-mode=, =python-mode=, and =yaml-mode= for customization.
